         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>We are well aſſured, that neither the former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor the preſent Governours did intend, or mean <hi>thus</hi> to tolerate, though they were tender to conſciences <hi>truly</hi> tender; their care was, and is, for the ejection of <hi>Scandalous, ignorant,</hi> and <hi>inſufficient</hi> Miniſters, and in their room, placing <hi>Godly, Learned, Orthodox Divines,</hi> the nobleſt work that can be undertaken, (if we may have liberty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our thoughts) in any Common wealth, that calls it ſelf Chriſtian. This man formerly placed in, and now ejected, was none of theſe; first, not <hi>Godly,</hi> becauſe, he denies the <hi>Godhead</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, vilifies his precious <hi>blood,</hi> which the<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.</note> Scripture calls the blood of God. A Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that wants a name <hi>black</hi> enough to be called by, in which any man living, and dying can never be ſaved, and

            <p>Thirdly, Not <hi>Orthodox,</hi> becauſe, his doctrines are <hi>Diametrically</hi> oppoſite to all thoſe that now are, or thoſe that have been received <hi>as</hi> ſuch, by the people of God in all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, and his expoſition, and application of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is a meer wretched and ſenſleſs corruption of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred text.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, No <hi>Divine,</hi> becauſe, his hereſies are, (if by the example of the<note n="*" place="margin">Appietatem, aut Lentulita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, <hi>Cic.</hi> epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol. lib. 3. epiſt. 7.</note> Oratour in <hi>Latine,</hi> we may have leave to coyn a word in <hi>Engliſh</hi>) rather <hi>Divellity,</hi> then <hi>Divinity.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Onday the eighteenth of <hi>September</hi> 1654, being the firſt day of the Commiſſioners meeting, a charge of articles was then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to them, againſt Doctor <hi>John Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> Rector of <hi>Bradfield</hi> in this county, who was thereupon, by warrant dated the ſame day under the hands and ſeals of five of the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, required to appear, and give anſwer to the ſaid articles on thurſday the fifth of <hi>October</hi> following, at the <hi>Bear</hi> in <hi>Speenhamland</hi> by <hi>Newbery,</hi> On which day the ſaid Doctor accordingly appeared, but produced no anſwer, onely pleaded he had been formerly diſcharged from the matters charged againſt him in the ſaid articles by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the former Committee of this county: which no way appearing to the Committee, it was then reſolved by them, that by vertue of the Ordinance they had power to queſtion the ſaid Doctor, upon the ſaid articles, and did then order him a copy of the ſaid articles, and further time
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118791:8"/> to give in his anſwer thereunto, till thurſday the nineteenth of the ſaid <hi>October.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At which time the ſaid Doctor again appearing, after many demurres by him made to the authority of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, in a <hi>comtemptuous</hi> way and manner, he did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite his anſwer in writing to the ſaid articles. But additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall articles being then exhibited againſt him, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ordered him a copy thereof, and gave him a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights time to bring in his anſwer to the ſaid additionall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and then to produce his witneſſes for proof of his defence, and juſtification to both the ſaid charges, and had ſummons granted for his ſaid witneſſes accordingly.</p>
            <p>On thurſday the ſecond of <hi>November,</hi> the ſaid Doctor made a further appearance, and gave in his anſwer to the ſaid additionall articles: and further additionall articles being then exhibited againſt the ſaid Doctor, the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners ordered him a copy thereof, and gave him furrher time to give in his anſwer thereunto, till the two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of the ſaid <hi>November,</hi> at the <hi>Bear</hi> in <hi>Reading,</hi> at which time they appointed to proceed upon the whole, and ordered witneſſes to be then and there produced on both ſides, as well for proof of the ſaid ſeverall charges, as of the Doctors anſwer and defence thereunto, and ſummons were iſſued out for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>On the ſaid two and twentieth of <hi>November,</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners meeting at the ſaid place, and receiving the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors anſwer to the third paper of articles, proceeded to examination for proof of the whole; and having ſpent the ſaid day in examination of ſeverall witneſſes for proof of the articles, they appointed to ſit the morrow after upon the ſame buſineſſe and then adjourned.</p>
            <p>The next day being the twentie third of the ſaid <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> they made further proceedings in the examination for proof of the articles, and after all the witneſſes for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that were then preſent, were examined in open Court, and in the Doctors own preſence, and by himſelf croſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined; the Commiſſioners required the Doctor to produce his witneſſes for his defence and juſtification, (if he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118791:8"/> which he refuſed, demanding to have firſt copies of the depoſitions againſt him, before he would produce his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which the Commiſſioners judging to be very <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> and <hi>irregular,</hi> thought not fit to grant unto him, and though they might then juſtly have proceeded to give their judgement, without giving him further time, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>default,</hi> yet notwithſtanding, ſuch was their tenderneſſe in the carriage of this buſineſſe, that they gave him further time to produce his ſaid witneſſes, <hi>(viz.)</hi> till the thirtieth of the ſaid <hi>November,</hi> at the <hi>Bear</hi> in <hi>Speenhamland;</hi> where the Doctor appeared not in perſon, but by his wife and others of his family excuſed his failer, in regard of ſickneſſe, and infirmity of body, under which (as they pretended) he then laboured, and could not appear without further dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his health, which excuſe (although no poſitive proof thereof was then made) was admitted by the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and further time yet given him, till the ſeventh of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> then following at the <hi>Bear</hi> in <hi>Reading.</hi> At which time the ſaid Commiſſioners proceeded to examine ſeverall other witneſſes then preſent, in behalf of the Proſecutours, which having done, they examined ſeverall witneſſes on the Doctors part and behalf, and the Doctor pretending to be ill, they adjourned for that time till the morrow morning following. But for that the Doctor had the ſame day produced ſeverall witneſſes in his behalf, who being ſworn, neither the queſtions propounded unto them by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, nor the evidence by them given did lead to juſtifie the Doctor from the matters charged, and proved againſt him, but merely dilatory, as was judged by the Commiſſioners. They did therefore require, that according to former order, he ſhould the next day give in the names of his witneſſes, together with his interrogatories in writing, to which he would have them examined, which the Commiſſioners might firſt conſider of but he peremptorily refuſed ſo to do, onely inſtead thereof, he offered ſeverall queſtions, which being taken by the Clark, were afterwards debated by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, and by them adjudged to be to as little purpoſe (though they ſhould be admitted to be true) as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118791:9"/> evidence already taken in his behalf, but only to delay, yet notwithſtanding they proceeded to examine two of the Doctors witneſſes to ſome of thoſe queſtions, which they judged moſt tending to his juſtification, which having done, and heard patiently what either the Doctor or his counſell could ſay at large, they cauſed the whole proceedings to be read over publickly, and then commanded the company to withdraw, that they might reſolve on their judgement, which was unanimouſly agreed on, for the ejectment of the Dr, out of the parſonage of <hi>Bradfield,</hi> for ſcandall, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and inſufficiency proved againſt him,</p>
            <p>

                  <p>There are ſeverall preparations laid down by Divines, as the conviction of ſin, the terrours of the law, the death of Chriſt, the free grace of God, which are (ſaid he) but <hi>fleſhly, and flaſhy</hi> diſcoveries.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall give you (ſaid the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>) the preparations accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſix dayes work in the creation, the ſeventh being that glorious reſt, when God comes in with his glory to the ſoul.</p>

                  <p>The third is a glorious liberty, which liberty (ſaid the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Dr) is not a liberty and freedome from the guilt of ſin, the curſe of the law, the wrath of God, purchaſed by the blood of <hi>another,</hi> and applied by the cleaving of the ſoul, but the fiery deity burning up our luſts, and corruptions in the center of the ſoul.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt is this: That God in Chriſt, and Chriſt in the ſaints, is the <hi>unity</hi> in <hi>trinity,</hi> and <hi>trinity</hi> in <hi>unity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is this: That Chriſt in his preparatory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his fiery deity, quite conſumes, and deſtroyes all ſin
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118791:12"/> and corruption, which conſuming of ſin is that <hi>doing away</hi> of tranſgreſſion, mentioned <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Tickhill</hi> is ſevere, and rigid, and ſo prejudice may barre the door againſt truth, then,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we requeſt that this teſtimony witneſſed and ſigned with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Pendarvis</hi> his own hand, may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are to certifie whom it may concern, that in a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at <hi>Ildeſly,</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Pordage</hi> did deliver theſe following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That Chriſt was a <hi>figure,</hi> and <hi>but</hi> a <hi>figure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the <hi>Godhead</hi> was <hi>mingled</hi> with our <hi>fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the <hi>imputative</hi> righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, was <hi>but</hi> a <hi>ſapleſſe</hi> righteouſneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the <hi>graces,</hi> and gifts of the ſpirit were <hi>but</hi> fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Pordage</hi> did <hi>falſely</hi> accuſe M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                     </gap>ecious to ſouls, in heaven, and earth is imbarqued in it; and becauſe the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> pretends viſions, and thoſe of ſuch height, and glory (as he calls them) that the like have not been <hi>heard,</hi> or <hi>ſeen:</hi> and becauſe his friends do intimate, that, theſe <hi>Angelicall</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are in order to the pure preaching of the goſpel to the Church, which hath been in <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> many hundred years,

                  </p>
                  <p>Truly it ſeems ſomewhat obſervable, that D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Pordage,</hi> who hath enjoyed ſuch viſions of glory, <hi>(as he ſaith)</hi> hath ſuch high diſcoveries, pretends to ſuch a pitch of ſanctity, and mortification, even to perfection.

                     <hi>guilt,</hi> to all Chriſtians hereabouts, that know him, and them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt witneſſe for the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> is <hi>Richard Higgs,</hi> we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not to mention the many ill-complexioned and hard ſpeeches, which this man hath uttered againſt the miniſtry, and maintenance. This language now a daies paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many, rather for a prime character of a godly man, (as they ſtile it) then for any fault; many (and we ſpeak it ſadly to ſee them ſo befooled) have little elſe to ſhew for their religion, but their being ſcurrilous, againſt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities,</hi> Miniſters, Learning, and maintenance. Do we ſpeak for our ſelves in this, or for the truth? the Lord knows, and our conſciences know, and the day will diſcover it.</p>
                  <p>So that the goſpel, religion, learning might thrive, &amp; proſper, we ſhould deſire to be ſilent, though we ſate in the duſt; and whatever become of us, or ours, or them, we can in ſome meaſure be contented, ſo that the <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel may dwell in the land.</p>
                  <p>This man is brought in by the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> as his chief witneſſe,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118791:13"/> he quotes him often, and doth preface his teſtimony, that, he is a <hi>pious, prudent,</hi> and a <hi>learned Chriſtian,</hi> and therefore to be heeded by the people, and believed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners.</p>
                  <p>Thus he depoſeth, that he heard the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> preach at <hi>Bradfield</hi> upon, and for the imputative righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, and this he atteſted with much confidence, but now obſerve theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Being demanded by the Commiſſioners very often, and earneſtly, to declare, what he conceived the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> did mean by Chriſts righteouſneſſe, he would at no hand (although he was upon his oath) reveal it. We were ſuſpicious at firſt that there might be ſome ugly, <hi>ſpeckled</hi> toad lying under a wholſome ſage leaf, ſome wretched familiſticall blaſphemy, under wholſome expreſſions, nothing more common: theſe late years paſt have diſcovered this practiſe, more then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny former generations; and therefore we preſſed him over and over, ſeeing he had been a ſeven years hearer at times, and a man intelligent, and one that penned the ſermons, that he would tell, what he conceived the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> did underſtand by Chriſts imputative righteouſneſſe, but there was no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing with him, he would not tell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Being further asked what he himſelf meant by Chriſts imputative righteouſneſſe, he would not tell, nor anſwer; either, this was his weakneſſe, that he could not tell, or elſe his wilfulneſſe, that he would not.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Being now prompted by the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, (from whom he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he had the<note n="*" place="margin">This practiſe of the Dr l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This pitifull anſwer makes us, who know his former profeſſion, think, that the fiery Deity and viſions of <hi>Bradfield,</hi> and a typicall Chriſt, are like to make this man
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118791:13"/> to forget, if not to ſlight the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, in the ſcripture; and now we have mentioned that bleſſed book denyed by many, and wofully neglected by moſt, the reader may obſerve in the next place ſomthing of this very witneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This Deponent was much infected with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and <hi>now ſpreading</hi> hereſie of anti-ſcripturiſme, he denied the Bible to be the word of God, and from whence he ſhould ſuck in this venome, we cannot imagine, but from <hi>Bradfield</hi> viſions, we are ſatisfied that this alſo is one of the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>s opinions, even becauſe, (though we have many other reaſons,) this man ſo much his intimate and boſome friend, and grand and choiſe diſciple, is of this judgement; theſe three particulars were witneſſed to his face, before his friends, by ſufficient teſtimony, as ſpoken by him.</p>

                  <p>The next is <hi>Daniel Roherts,</hi> he is quoted by the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>as</hi> a witneſſe for him, and here we do profeſſe our pen is very loath to give down its ink, we do find in us a very great <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe</hi> from naming of any names, but, <hi>moſt of all,</hi> neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> hath named them often, and pleads for them, and laies great <hi>ſtreſſe</hi> upon them, and the cauſe is Chriſts, therefore we may not ſeek the favour, or fear the face of man.

                  <p>The next is <hi>Mary Pocock,</hi> a woman formerly of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſpirit, who ſeeking reſt, and not finding it, hath turned aſide to <hi>lying</hi> vanities, and hath layed out her <hi>money</hi> for that which is not bread, we are horribly afraid for her, that ſhe is gone off quite from looking for juſtification and life by a Chriſt without her, a moſt Chriſt <hi>diſhonouring,</hi> and a ſoul <hi>damning,</hi> yet a <hi>dandled</hi> and <hi>huggd</hi> opinion amongſt very many, at this day; <hi>as</hi> to her teſtimony conſider.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that ſhe depoſeth againſt Mr <hi>Tickhills</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Stevens</hi> oath, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, She is one of the D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> family, fellowſhip, &amp; the country ſaith, community as to goods, and it is thought, it may concern her, in caſe the Dr be ejected.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We are aſſured, the Drs tenet is, that he <hi>may ſay,</hi> and unſay, though he ſay in his book, twas ſaid maliciouſly, to caſt an <hi>odium</hi> upon him, and for his practiſe, we have found his anſwers moſt notoriouſly falſe, now this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man we fear, is too much one of his diſciples.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This woman refuſed an oath at <hi>Reding</hi> when ſhe was to ſpeak for the truth, in ſome articles againſt the Dr, and the very next week, at <hi>Newbery</hi> when ſhe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for him, ſhe was altogether as forward to take her oath.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, She being examined at <hi>Newbery,</hi> upon that oath which ſhe had taken for the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, whether ſhe did not relate to ſome perſons of honour, how the Dr had contended with the Dragon, three hours in his chamber, ſaying to one another <hi>thou lyeſt, and thou lyeſt,</hi> and whether ſhe did not relate that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118791:15"/> the D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> children were ſtrangely acted in their legs, and thighs, and arms, and whether ſhe did not relate to them, how M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> 
                     <hi>Flavell</hi> had been in a trance, and how ſhe had found the Philoſophers ſtone, which had puzzel'd ſo many wiſe men, (viz.) the <hi>divinity</hi> in the <hi>humanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>She made an anſwer in a careleſſe way, to our amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and pity, <hi>(ſc.)</hi> ſhe could not tell whether ſhe told <hi>them ſo, or no,</hi> perhaps <hi>ſhe did,</hi> perhaps <hi>ſhe did not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is wonderfull ſtrange, that ſuch extraordinary paſſages, related by her in a glorying way, when they were reaking hot, nay when it was (as ſhe phraſed it) given in to her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal them, and ſhe did reveal them to perſons of honour and unqueſtionable evidence, who do ſtill atteſt it, and when ſhe was minded of ſome circumſtances of the relation, ſhe did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſomething of them, it is much (we ſay) that ſhe ſhould no better remember this her own relation. doth not this woman think that ſhe may ſay any thing to ſave the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> from the world?</p>

                     <p>We are well aſſured that all fearing God in the nation, will with their ſouls conſent with us, that the Deniall of the Godhead of our Lord Jeſus, the making a <hi>piff</hi> at his precious bloud, and calling his compleat righteouſneſſe a poor, vain thing, that the Lord Chriſt is but a type, are blaſphemies that open their mouth againſt heaven, and are of as high a nature, as wretched men, or damned ſpirits can be guilty of: and doe at once, ſo directly deſtroy ſcriptures, duties, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, graces, glory, all. <hi>Now</hi> if this defence of the D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> be true, we profeſſe our unfeigned ſorrow from our inmoſt hearts, that the bleſſed glory of our dear Lord Chriſt was no more conſulted for, if there be no proviſion made, for the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118791:15"/> ſtopping of the <hi>mouth</hi> of blaſphemy againſt the Lord Jeſus, by the <hi>Civile</hi> Magiſtrate.</p>
                     <p>We profeſſe we cannot but <hi>wonder</hi> at the great <hi>raſhneſſe</hi> of this D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, and <hi>lament</hi> the <hi>diſhonour</hi> (as we humbly think) that this vain man caſts upon authority, in that he proclaims upon the houſe top, and tells it in <hi>Gath,</hi> that <hi>hideous</hi> bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemies againſt Jeſus Chriſt, are not puniſhable by the Commiſſioners of the ſeverall counties; which God forbid, and we believe all the Saints will ſay Amen. And we do with caſe and comfort perſwade our ſelves, that the ſupreme Magiſtrate doth not intend it, and will never ſuffer it.</p>
                     <p>Whereas ſome do blame the Commiſſioners for being immethodicall, for not reducing the articles under the head, ignorance, we anſwer, that the articles alledged, and proved, do indeed ſhew him guilty of the greateſt ignorance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, that is imaginable, and doth abundantly clear the juſtice of the ſentence: yet theſe articles when they were exhibited, were look'd upon as having too much hideouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them, that the Commiſſioners could not find in their hearts, to rank them under any other head, but that of bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy, and do ſtill look on them as worthy to be branded with the blackeſt Epithite that hell can afford.</p>
                     <p>And if it be true (as ſome do ſay it is, and therefore do ſay, the Commiſſioners do they cannot tell what themſelves, for theſe articles do not come under the act, as they pretend) then, we ſhall not be ſo quiet in our conſciences as we deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, unleſſe we beg leave to ſay, that it was no teſtimony of over and above kindneſſe to Jeſus Chriſt, in thoſe perſons that drew up that act, (&amp; who they were, we profeſſe before the <hi>ſearcher</hi> of <hi>hearts,</hi> we know not) to draw it up ſo, as not to <hi>mention,</hi> nor <hi>mean</hi> the ſafeguarding of his glory, from the tongues of blaſphemers, which are ſet on <hi>fire of hell:</hi> We ſay again, if <hi>it be true,</hi> we do not ſay it is ſo, we cannot ſay it: and therefore, were we fit, (as indeed we are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unfit,) we would in all humility beſeech his Highneſſe Honourable Counſell to take this matter into conſideration, and to determine as they ſee cauſe, that ſo for the future, all clamours of men, and quibbles of counſellours may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118791:16"/> and every article may be reduced under its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per head. The ground of our requeſt is this, we are fully perſwaded they will never ſuffer any to be <hi>Preachers</hi> of the Goſpel, who are <hi>blaſphemers</hi> of the Lord Jeſus, who is the ſubſtance of the goſpel, in whom all the <hi>promiſes are yea, and amen,</hi> and whoſe precious bloud is the bloud of the <hi>everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting covenant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have been preſſed in our ſpirits to this boldneſſe, through the grief of our hearts, becauſe we do in ſome pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance perceive what, through the wretched confidence of profane ones, and the ſecret confidence of morall ones in their own civile righteouſneſſe, and what through the<note n="n" place="margin">For ſo theſe would be thought.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteneſſe of <hi>Socinianiſme,</hi> and the<note n="n" place="margin">For ſo theſe would be thought.</note> oaringneſſe of <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſme,</hi> and the croaking of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and the ſpreading of all theſe, there are very poor, mean, and ſlight thoughts all the land over, in city and countrey, of the glory, love, bloud, and merits of our Lord Jeſus, who is God over all, Bleſſed for ever.

                     <p>But he <hi>complain's much</hi> pag. 71. <hi>that the Commiſſioners would not take in his witneſſes, who could depoſe how he had preached againſt conjuration, which witneſſes he names

               </p>
               <p>To diſprove this, we offer theſe conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that Miſtriſſe <hi>Grip</hi> being then upon her oath, did ſolemnly appeal to the Lord of heaven, the ſearcher of all hearts, that ſhe did not ſpeak a <hi>ſword of</hi> Maſter <hi>Fowler,</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:118791:21"/> neither had ſo much as a <hi>thought</hi> of him, and that ſhe was ſo far from <hi>tears and wringed hands,</hi> (as this man feignes) That ſhe was in ſome meaſure of <hi>joy,</hi> in the apprehenſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhe did affirm, before <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and above two hundred perſons, that it was all <hi>falſe,</hi> and a <hi>mere forgery,</hi> not a word of it true.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider this, that about a fortnight before his tryall was at the Bear in <hi>Reding,</hi> Maſter <hi>Daniel Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> told her the ſaid Miſtris <hi>Grip</hi> that the Dr would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to the Commiſſioners, how ſhe had railed againſt Maſter <hi>Fowler,</hi> upon which, ſhe came to Maſter <hi>Fowler</hi>'s houſe immediately, where Maſter <hi>Nutkins,</hi> one of the Commiſſioners, with ſome friends, then was, and ſhe was exceedingly moved at the D<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>

So that as the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> anſwer was premeditated, through wickedneſſe, her anſwer upon her oath, was premeditated <hi>alſo,</hi> through <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, As to that paſſage of the Drs contriving, or ſome of his <hi>Angels,</hi> what Maſter <hi>Fowler</hi> ſhould report &amp;c. Maſter <hi>Fowler</hi> remembers not any ſuch thing reported by him to any of the <hi>gentry, as his own judgement;</hi> the truth is, many of the <hi>gentry</hi> have rather wondered at his ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and <hi>ſilence,</hi> when occaſion of ſuch diſcourſe hath bin offered, the ground of which <hi>ſilence</hi> was ſincerely this, when he looked upon the reports of many, ſix or ſeuen years ſince, and the ſuſpicions of ſome godly perſons, he durſt not <hi>juſtifie</hi> her, and on the other ſide, when he looked upon her <hi>profeſſion, gifts, expreſſions, temptations,</hi> he durſt not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn</hi> her <hi>eſpecially</hi> when he looked upon her temptations, which he believed to be reall, and his judgement is, that a tempted perſon may without any great difficulty diſcern the temptations of another, whether <hi>they</hi> are from pretence. and <hi>hypocriſie,</hi> or whether they are from reality, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118791:21"/> 
                  <hi>feeling,</hi> eſpecially if they have frequent conference.</p>
               <p>What paſſages of <hi>lewdneſſe</hi> there have bin, or whether any he knovves not, he hath ſpoken unto them both of this <hi>very ſin,</hi> ſix years ſince in private, and both did deny it, he leaves them, and the iſſue to God, but the riſe of the Drs <hi>forgery</hi> and <hi>lying.</hi> he believes upon good ground to be ſo falſe, that he thinks the firſt deſerves the <hi>Pillery,</hi> the ſecond may claim the <hi>whetſtone,</hi> and the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fourthly; Again conſider that this Deponent Miſtris <hi>Grip</hi> did relate this of the Drs blaſphemy to Maſter <hi>Fowler,</hi> and the other, of apparitions with indignation &amp; grief, before ever the ordinance for ejecting came forth, ſaying to him and others, ſhall <hi>this blaſphemer continue to bewitch ſouls?</hi> and will the <hi>higher powers do nothing?</hi> ſhall ſuch be <hi>tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo?</hi> now, whether this woman, who profeſſeth tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit, even againſt the leaſt untruthes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpoken much againſt this mans blaſphemies, and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, before any Commiſſioners were in being, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt them no perſonall grudge, (as to the world, ſhe is a looſer, and did expect to be ſo before hand,) ſhould ſo ſolemnly depoſe before God and Angells an untruth, we leave it to the judgement of indifferent men.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Beſides if the Drs diſcourſe were (as he pleads clearly againſt his own conſcience) ſuch, as it is in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, let the Reader conſider, what colour even in the leaſt can there be, for Miſtris <hi>Grips</hi> queſtion, (viz) <hi>what then Dr?</hi> and his anſwer to that queſtion, (viz.) <hi>I do not uſe to reveal my ſelf, but I do not know, what the matter is, I muſt ſpeak to you;</hi> for conſider, what is there in the Drs anſwer, but that any man may ſpeak to any perſon.</p>
               <p>But this is juſt like Maſter <hi>Erbury,</hi> who, when he had ſpoken moſt bitter things againſt the Lord Jeſus, to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding chriſtian (of which you ſhall hear by and by) clapt him on the arm, telling him, <hi>I do not uſe to reveal my ſelf ſo to others.</hi>

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:118791:22"/>
               <p>The truth is, the Dr ſeeing Miſtris <hi>Grip</hi> to be fixed, and knowing her teſtimony would be looked on as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious, and in ſome hopes of his own fooliſh heart, thinking to make her a <hi>Proſelyte,</hi> and on that account ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving revealed to her that, which he knew would <hi>very</hi> much diſcover him, he thought to try this laſt attempt, whether he might <hi>affright</hi> her out of her teſtimony, but this would not do, ſhe being throughly reſolved to go through all <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi> to bear witneſſe againſt ſuch <hi>horrid</hi> blaſphemies, for the <hi>glory</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This laſt was depoſed before the Commiſſioners, by Mr <hi>Stevens,</hi> an underſtanding Chriſtian, who being juſtly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>We do foreſee, that Mr <hi>Blagrave</hi> will be unſatisfied for our ſpeaking ſo <hi>much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our anſwer is, that we are unſatisfied ſometimes in our <hi>conſciences,</hi> for <hi>ſpeaking</hi> ſo <hi>little.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the article it ſelf of Chriſts being a type,</p>
               <p>We entreat the reader to obſerve the fulneſſe of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, depoſing that the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> ſaid, <hi>that Chriſt was a type, and but a type.</hi> Now, we ceaſe to wonder, that one of his choiſe ones ſhould ſpeak thus, to knowing perſons, and reputed godly, who were on purpoſe ſpeaking of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, viz. <hi>I fear many make an idoll of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as though truſting in the Lord Jeſus crucified, <hi>without us,</hi> were <hi>idolatry.</hi> And another of <hi>his</hi> diſciples, who ſpeaking before of the preſent conteſt, concerning Chriſts righteouſneſſe, ſaid thus, <hi>what need I to contend and wrangle about that which I my ſelf am, which I have eſſentially in me.</hi> Nay the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf delivered this in the pulpit, long ſince his pretended <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe</hi> with the Angels, and his <hi>viſions</hi> of the eternall world, (viz.) <hi>whoſoever did attain to a particular faith, theſe ſigns ſhall follow, they ſhall ſpeak with new tongues, they ſhall lay hands on the ſick, God will bring them to glory, and God the Father will deliver up to them the keyes of his everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Godhead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude,</p>
               <p>This never enough accurſed doctrine of a <hi>typicall</hi> Chriſt, did ſpread like a gangrene in <hi>Calvins</hi> time; a little after in <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>Henry Nicholai,</hi> born in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> an <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> man, but a <hi>crafty</hi> hypocrite, and one that had a kind of <hi>deceiving</hi> violence, in his <hi>ſmooth</hi> language of love: ſince that, in <hi>New-England,</hi> by <hi>Gortyn</hi> and his diſciples; and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118791:29"/> then again in <hi>England</hi> very lately, Mr <hi>Rutherford</hi> who is good at <hi>ſurveys,</hi> and <hi>viewing,</hi> gives a moſt ſhrewd gueſſe, that the tokens of this <hi>ſoul-plague</hi> are to be ſeen upon the books of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Saltmarſh,</hi> &amp;c: and now at this day this plague-mark is viſible to every eye, and creeping about many hearts. Is it not a ſad thing, that perſons ſhould take in ſuch notions of Chriſt, that do altogether deſtroy Chriſt? that <hi>blaſpheme</hi> his perſon, <hi>reproach</hi> his bloud, <hi>deny</hi> his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, and that <hi>make</hi> his infinite love and grace to <hi>poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> to ſignifie juſt nothing? in which notions a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>godly</hi> while he lives, and muſt be <hi>damned</hi> when he dies, for the riſe, progreſſe, growth, and continuance of found godlineſſe flowes from the right knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Do we not ſee theſe <hi>figure</hi>-makers, and makers of <hi>types,</hi> which God never made, which <hi>never came into his heart,</hi> what <hi>ſhadowy, empty</hi> creatures they are? the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Familiſts</hi> have nothing for the <hi>ſoul</hi> reall in this world, their light is <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> their ſublimated notions <hi>froth,</hi> their words <hi>bubbles,</hi> their holineſſe mere <hi>varniſh,</hi> their auſterity, <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiſme,</hi> their faſting and prayer (when they do it) a <hi>device</hi> to entrap ſouls, their publick <hi>demureneſſe,</hi> private <hi>looſneſſe,</hi> their comfort, a <hi>deluſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What they ſhall have in the next world (in caſe of finall impenitence, which the Lord of mercy forbid) is reall <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> but what is it? but a <hi>ſence</hi> of wrath, and <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin, even againſt this now blaſphemed Jeſus Chriſt, a <hi>worm</hi> of conſcience, a <hi>lake</hi> of fire, the <hi>gnawings</hi> of heart, which are really ſo grievous that no heart can think or gueſſe; and all this without remedy, without eaſe, even <hi>for ever and ever.</hi>

                     <p>I never heard the leaſt intimation from any, that he was

                     <p>After his abſence I do further affirm, that I feared and was ſtrongly inclined to believe, that according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rumour, he was a conjurer; hereupon I was in a great ſtreight in my own ſpirit, whether I ſhould proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him or not: my zeal to Gods glory, and my obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the commands of God, that ſaith,<note n="†" place="margin">Not a word true, read the note upon his proteſtation.</note> ſuffer not a witch to live, giving me ſome impulſions to do it, but after ſerious debate and conſideration within my ſelf?

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118791:35"/> may remember in the 37. article of Government, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, That all ſuch as profeſſe faith in God by Jeſus Chriſt, though differing in judgement from the doctrine, worſhip, and diſcipline, publickly held forth, ſo as they abuſe not this liberty to the civil injury of others, nor to the actuall diſturbance of the publick peace, ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and then ſurely their hungry bellies may be fed, their bodies clothed, their perſons lodged, and their wants ſupplied.</p>
                     <p>And further, my ends are theſe, which are pure and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall, that I may prove all things, and hold faſt that which is good, that I may t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now the cauſe of many<note n="1" place="margin">We never heard of any but thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the next animad.</note> ſtrangers coming to me as gueſts, from all quarters of this land, ariſeth from thoſe lying printed pamphlets, that have ſcarce a word of truth in them, theſe draw all ſeeking inquiring minds to viſit me, for divers ends beſt known unto themſelves.

                     <p>In a word, the ſtrengh of this article doth but amount to thus much, that as<note n="2" place="margin">Mark the compariſon, there is pride, and non ſence in it.</note> Chriſt was ſuppoſed and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a friend of Publicanes and ſinners, ſo am I reputed a friend to all people that profeſſe Religion, and walk or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly be their opinions in matter of doctrine or diſcipline,

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:118791:41"/> was, and doth ſtill that ſhe had had a ſecond husband, which ſome in the<note n="4" place="margin">What world? not of this world that we know of, nor any one that we can learn by.</note> world knew of very well, whoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies ſhe can and will produce, when ſhe hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent occaſion offered, by a legall call thereto, who is alſo able and ready to give a ſufficient accompt when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerves, of her not openly aſſuming her ſecond huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands name, her eſtate then ſtanding as it did, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving concealed for that time ſhe was in Law, ſhe thought<note n="*" place="margin">O ſilly and poor ſhift!</note> good ever ſince to be called by her firſt husbands name: but this ſubtle dealing of her adverſaries, by libelling ſcandalls, without poſitively aſſerting ſhe was not marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, makes her incapable or recovering any dammage of thoſe who now<note n="5" place="margin">We never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned any thing but this. ſc. if they do not produce the father <hi>Frewin.</hi> the Dr muſt be the father or the Pandar.</note> enuiouſly, yet indirectly aſperſe her, which the Commiſſioners ought to take notice of, who ſhould not receive ſuch libells which tend to the blaſting of ones credit and good name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which all ſober Chriſtians (ought for the Goſpels ſake) to value, and yet abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove nothing of ſuch criminous fact, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign ſeemingly to prove, nor yet give ſufficient ground of calling them to an account, for ſuch evill and malicious ſcandalls; but this not directly concerning me, I ſhall omit much which might be ſpoken of it.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, That I came often to viſit her. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is not true, it was rather ſeldome, being but three times in three quarters of a year, and that in Term time, upon ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occaſions at Law.</p>
                        <p>"Eighthly, That I removed her to <hi>Kenſington. Anſ.</hi> That is falſe, For I knew not when ſhe removed thither.</p>
                        <p>Ninthly, That I paid the Smith, for her being at his houſe. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is another untruth, I never paid him a penny, neither did I ever agree with him for her being there.</p>
                        <p>Tenthly, That the nurſes husband wrote a letter to me at <hi>Bradfield</hi> for mony for the childs nurſing. <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a mere lye, for no ſuch letter was writ, neither did I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver agree for to pay for the nurſing of it, as the nurſe and her husband can witneſſe.</p>
                        <p>Eleventhly, That ſhortly after he ſent for the child
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:118791:42"/> away, this I alſo deny, it containing two untruths in it: for firſt, the child was not ſhortly after ſent for away, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I ſend for it at all, for it was fot away by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Twelfthly, That a little while after, the ſaid little one was brought into my family. <hi>Anſwer,</hi> this is alſo falſe.</p>
                        <p>Thirteenthly, As to the ſeventh article of this libelling charge, in which many circumſtances are produced to ſcandall the gentlewoman, as though ſhe had told a great untruth it deſerves no other anſwer but this, that it is compacted of many lies, nothing being there true, that really tends to prejudice her, as I believe will appear by the event.</p>
                        <p>Thus, in this ſhort relation, wherein there is ſome truth, pray take notice how many untruthes, and mere lyes are mixed with it to put a beautifull face upon an envious and unchriſtian deſign, and is not this to bear falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt ones neighbour? may not any ones inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and integrity, be in this manner undeſervedly clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, aſperſed, and wounded, which I leave to the ſerious conſiderations of the Judges.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>As to my affirmative anſwer, what I acknowledge is this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>About nine years ſince, I brought behind me from <hi>London</hi> the fore-mentioned Mrs <hi>Flavell,</hi> who had been of ancient and near acquaintance with me, and my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: to one Goodman <hi>Loughtons,</hi> a Smith in <hi>Heſſen,</hi> where, ſome four or five months after, ſhe was brought to bed of a daughter, which ſhe owned to the people where ſhe then was, to be by a ſecond husband, even as ſhe ſtill acknowledgeth, and further that I viſited her three times in the ſpace of three quarters of a year, at term time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then ingaged in a Law ſuit, that concerned her that one of theſe times I chriſtned her child, and called it <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> that afterwards her occaſions requiring not ſo much
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:118791:42"/> privacy, ſhe came to live with her ancient acquaintance at my houſe, where alſo for ſome years her daughter hath been with her.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to take away any thing that may ſeem to reflect upon me in this my acknowledgement, pray conſider theſe ſubſequent particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <q>That I and Mr <hi>Pordage,</hi> being of very near and long acquaintance with her, it was but a friends courteſie for me upon her deſire, to carry her to this houſe behind me. That ſhe had ſufficient ground to retire into ſome ſuch place in the countrey, in that the city air was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to her health.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <q>In that by the counſell of able Lawyers ſhe was adviſed to retire to ſome private place; ſhe being then in law, ingagements, and continually ſubject to arreſts, by the intanglements of her firſt husbands eſtate: her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law, who was her adverſary, then threatning to ſeize on her if ſhe were above ground.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <q>In reference to my ingagement in her law buſineſſe, I think it materiall, briefly to relate the grounds, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of it in the time of her widowhood: her brother in law began a ſuit with her in the Common law, which, fearing he ſhould be there overthrown, he removed to the Chancery. Now ſhe being very unfit, and uncapable to mannage this her ſelf, ſhe earneſtly deſired me as an ancient and truſty friend, to undertake it. Upon this, I went to Judge <hi>Roles,</hi> and Mr <hi>Chuts</hi> with her, who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into her evidences, and into the will of her late decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed husband, found that for want of one clauſe in it, ſhe was liable to many ſuits and arreſts, and to great intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that her intereſt could not be eſtabliſhed, but by much difficulty, and at length this was the reſult of the Counſell. That ſhe muſt let all her eſtate which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der morgage, be forfeited into the hand of ſome faithfull friend, and ſo ſell it away. Hence, I, through much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, layed down ſome hundred pounds, reſcued the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and ſo became intereſted in a ſuit at Chancery, which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118791:43"/> laſted three years. Now, from this may further appear ſufficient ground. Firſt, why I brought her to that private houſe. Secondly, why I came to her in the time of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, I then received mony from her to follow her ſuite. Thirdly, why I came alone, it being then her intereſt to be concealed, being ſubject to arreſts.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I ſhall proceed to adde ſome few circumſtances more, which may ſerve to clear me before all ſober perſons.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Firſt, At my coming I told the people my name, and that I dwelt at<note n="6" place="margin">Could not you have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all this pains by one certificate, where her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand lived, and died? had not you four monethes time, before your ſentence?</note> 
                           <hi>Reding,</hi> that I was miniſter of St <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> Church, knowing the gentlewoman to be ſober and pious, now, had I been, as my enemies enviouſly pretend, I might have concealed my name, quality, and place of reſidence.</p>
                        <p>We diſcovered to them, that the gentlewoman had an eſtate in the bulwork at <hi>London,</hi> and rents there to receive, which they might enquire after, (as they did for their ſecurity) now this was not the way to cover a work of darkneſſe.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, She ſometime went to <hi>London</hi> to the Lawyers, whilſt ſhe vvas there, ſome belonging to that family ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companing her, vvho found, that as ſhe had related ſhe vvas in great troubles at Lavv, and vvere convinced that ſhe retired on that accompt.</p>
                        <p>Now in reference to moſt of thoſe particulars, in which I have contradicted and denied the alledged circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and further vindicated my ſelf, they are exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with what I have in writing confeſſed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, by <hi>Loughton</hi> himſelf, from whom this charge is pretended to be received, and by the nurſe of the child, ſubſcribed by them both before witneſſes, which acknowledgement I ſhall produce, when I ſee occaſion.</p>
                        <p>And by this I hope it may appear, to moderate, ſober, and judicious men, that this libelling charge, drawn up ſo falſly, enviouſly, and yet ſo ſubtily,<note n="*" place="margin">It was called upon as ſoon as known.</note> calling from the dead a buſineſſe paſt ſome nine or ten years ſince ſince, (which though it were criminous) as it is not) were le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:118791:43"/> to prejudice by the Act of oblivion, or generall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as all other things pretended to be ſpoken or acted by me before 1651. according to the judgement of judicious men, which I leave to the Commiſſioners to conſider of; I ſay, that this is but the effect of the evil and wicked po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of my accuſer, brought forth to prejudice and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloud that pure and innocent principle which I profeſſe, and faithfully live to; and the better to cover that evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign they have againſt my perſon, and livelyhood.</p>
                        <p>And now I appeal to the Commiſſioners, and to all that are pious, and ſober minded, whether my enemies do not deal very unreaſonably, enviouſly, and unlike Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, from this buſineſſe ſo long ſince paſt, which nothing criminous, is poſitively objected againſt me, to draw ſuch horrid concluſions, as commonly to report, that I now live in baſe luſt and wantonneſſe: notwithſtanding my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending of, and owning the virgin life, I ſay, whether this be not exceeding hard meaſure, and ungodly dealing, let all judge But I ſee that deſign of the Devil in it, which mine enemies may be ignorant of, which is, to overcloud, and darken by monſtrous lies, and ſcandalls, which are the ſmoke of the bottomleſſe pit, that<note n="7" place="margin">We deſire the reader (if he pleaſe to take the pains,) to conſider the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimad. upon his virgin life, with theſe that follow, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling words of vanity.</note> life of purity, chaſtity, mortification, ſelf deniall, and heavenly enjoyments, which God hath favoured me to live in; and ſo to affright all from my acquaintance, which otherwiſe might very much prejudice, and overthrow his kingdome. For the old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent knows very well, as alſo my near friends and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that for above theſe four years, even ſince the time of my great trialls, by the extraordinary temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and repreſentations of the devil, that I have been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted more then ordinary, from all outward things, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my ſelf up wholly to prayer, watchfulneſſe, mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and conſtant ſelf deniall; in dying to all earthly pleaſures, even to things permitted, and accounted lawfull, as finding many things which ordinarily imbraced, to be great hinderances of the ſouls progreſſe to God, and great burthens to a ſpirit which taſted much of that tree of life, which groweth in the midſt of the Paradice of God, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:118791:44"/> great cloys to a ſoul that ſees through the vail of the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive nature, into the ſpirituall glory of eternity. But what I have enjoyed and experimented in this time of my extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary mortification, and ſelf deniall, in the death of the animall man, and riſing of Chriſts image in me, is not ſeaſonable now to declare; yet, for the glory of my God, and the undeceiving of thoſe who ſtrangely miſtake me: Thus much in all humility I muſt ſay, that did my accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers and my enemies know, what I have enjoyed in this way of the croſſe, of the ſecret hidden treaſure of eternity, and of the out-goings of divine goodneſſe, were they but acquainted with thoſe diſcoveries of celeſtiall glory, inſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the heavenly dew, and ſecret touches of the holy Ghoſt, did they but know thoſe bright irradiations of eternall light, thoſe ſtrong motions of divine life, and pleaſant ſtreams of eternall love, together with thoſe deep ſufferings, in bearing Chriſts croſſe, which I and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in my family, have in this time experienced, they durſt not thus condemn and judge me as an evil doer, and one that lives in the luſts of the fleſh; but my God hath taught me whilſt they curſe, to pray for them, whilſt they deſign to ruine me, to love them, and whilſt they hate me, to ſay with Chriſt, Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</p>
                        <p>This I thought fit, in all humility, to annex to that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling charge, concerning Mrs <hi>Flavell:</hi> from which I have undeſervedly ſuffered ſo much, by the malice of the devil, and now I ſhall proceed to anſwer the remaining articles, one of which is intermixed with the former ſeven that concern M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>

               <p>Let the reader obſerve, that to that article, <hi>that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is the way of beaſts,</hi> the Dr gives no particular anſwer, and good reaſon, for to affirm it before the face of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, had been very <hi>monſtrous,</hi> and to <hi>deny</hi> it, had been <hi>notorious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the buſineſſe of Mrs <hi>Flavells</hi> child <hi>Hannah,</hi> we deſire the reader to obſerve, Firſt, That the Dr in his anſwer to this article would call the child by no <hi>ſirname at all,</hi> but <hi>only Hannah,</hi> and being demanded by the Commiſſioners to tell them <hi>Hannah</hi> what? what beſides <hi>Hannah,</hi> even to the deriſion and wonder of all ſtanders by, he would by no means give in any particular anſwer but <hi>Hannah,</hi> and I will ſay nothing but <hi>Hannah,</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> what you will, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the Dr ſhould carry away the mother with child to a private place, and after baptize the child, and take mother and child back again into his ovvn family, for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118791:46"/> ſome years, and yet not know the <hi>ſirname</hi> ſeems to us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible.</p>
               <p>But what ſhould the man ſay, it muſt have been called by him either <hi>Hannah Frewin,</hi> or <hi>Hannah Flavell,</hi> or <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah Pordage,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Hannah:</hi> the firſt, <hi>Hannah Frewin</hi> had been to make the child daughter of a man, that for ought yet appears never was in the world, for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>Hannah Flavell</hi> had been to make her the child of a father dead two or three years before ſhe was born; for the laſt, <hi>Hannah Pordage</hi> if it were true, (as it is very poſſible) yet it was not ſafe as yet, as yet the times will not blaze it, there is a <hi>pure</hi> word wreſted to a <hi>ranting</hi> ſenſe viz. <hi>All things are lawfull, but not expedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Conſider that in open Court, Mrs <hi>Flavell</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing and being demanded by thee Regiſter what her name was, anſwered <hi>Mary Flavell,</hi> and being demanded the ſecond <hi>time,</hi> gave the ſame anſwer, <hi>Mary Flavell,</hi> and being minded by the Regiſter that ſurely ſhe did <hi>forget</hi> her ſelf, her name was <hi>Mary Frewin,</hi> ſhe anſwered, <hi>Mary Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,</hi> or <hi>Mary Frewin</hi> which you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The child was often denied by her to be her child, and commonly taken for her neece, till it was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Roger Loughton,</hi> at whoſe houſe the child was born, the timpany proving to be a daughter, whoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is uery conſiderable. the man being rationall, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, refuſing all occaſions of being tempted, for before his teſtimony was given in, the Dr with all his women ſent for him to an <hi>Inne</hi> in <hi>Hounſlow,</hi> but he refuſed, the next day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tueſday they came to his houſe at <hi>Heſton,</hi> but he was gone to <hi>Branford,</hi> whether the Dr and his company went and inquired for his ſhop, where they found him, and would needs perſwade him to go with them to the tavern to drink a pint of wine, he replyed, he had no body to look to his ſhop, the Dr told him he would give a boy ſixpence to look to his ſhop in the mean time, he anſwered no, he was about his buſineſſe, if they had any thing to ſay to him he would give them an anſwer there right, he thinks if he would have been ſo baſe as to have been <hi>tampered</hi> into ſilence, he might
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118791:46"/> have had <hi>a round ſome of mony,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">This was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of the laſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt.</note> the diſcovery is obſervable for theſe two providences in it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The manner which was this, a plain country man of <hi>Bradfield</hi> went to <hi>Heſton</hi> to ſee his brother living there, with whom, on the Lords day, he went to <hi>Haworth</hi> to hear the ſermon, where alſo was this <hi>Roger Loughton,</hi> a frequent hearer there, after the evening exerciſe there were two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren baptized, and all being finiſhed by a providence, the country man of <hi>Bradfield,</hi> and his brother, and <hi>Roger Loughton,</hi> met and went home together, going in the way the country man began to diſcourſe, and ſaid to his brother, <hi>I have ſeen more to day then I have ſeen theſe two years,</hi> I have ſeen <hi>a child baptized, our Dr will not baptize, Roger Loughton</hi> not knowing who the man was, nor where he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, asked his country, and his Drs name, the man told him Dr <hi>Pordage,</hi> at a place called <hi>Bradfield</hi> in <hi>Berks, Loughton</hi> ſmiled and queſtioned the man about Mrs <hi>Flavell,</hi> and how many children ſhe had, the man replyed one, a boy named <hi>Stephen,</hi> and being asked whether ſhe had not a daughter, was anſwered by the country man, no, never a child that we know of but only her boy <hi>Stephen,</hi> R. <hi>Loughton</hi> ſaid, <hi>yes,</hi> she hath, and I knew when the Dr would baptize, for she was brought to bed at my houſe of a daughter, and the Dr came and baptized it himſelf, and called it <hi>Hannah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſecond providence is the time when, and that was about a moneth before the Commiſſioners were <hi>authorized</hi> by the Ordinance; therefore whereas the Dr ſaith we rake in the grave of the dead, we reply the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall was <hi>proſecuted</hi> as ſoon as it vvas diſcovered, there vvas not tvvo moneths reſpite betvveen the one and the other.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the articles contained in this third charge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt of them concerning the Drs viſions, both of the Dr and the reſt of his family, and others of his followers, and of their ſtrange and unheard of apparitions, revelations, trances and raptures, converſe with Angels both good and<note n="*" place="margin">All principles and practiſes, tending to Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſme, Sorcery, and ſeducing of others.</note> bad, ſhall not be here particularly diſtinguiſhed, but for brevity ſake put together as they were exhibited together
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118791:47"/> with his anſwers thereunto, and the proofs together after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as followeth.</p>
               <p>That he hath very frequent and familiar converſe with Angels.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That a great Dragon came into his chamber, with a tail of eight yards long, four great teeth, and did ſpit fire at him, and that he contended with the Dragon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That his own Angel came and ſtood by him while he was expoſtulating with the Dragon, and that his Angel came in his own ſhape and faſhion, the ſame cloathes, band and cuffs, the ſame banſtrings, and that his Angel ſtood by him, and upheld him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>that Mrs</hi> Pordage <hi>and Mrs</hi> Flavell <hi>had their Angels ſtanding by them alſo, Mrs</hi> Pordage <hi>ſinging ſweetly, and keeping time upon her breaſt, and that her cbil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſaw the ſpirits coming into the houſe, and ſaid,</hi> Look there Father, <hi>and that the ſpirits did often come into the chamber, and drew the curtains when they were in bed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That the ſaid Mr</hi> Pordage <hi>confeſſed that a ſtrong inchantment was upon him, and that the Divel did appear to him in the ſhape of</hi> Everard, <hi>and in the ſhap<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured"

               <p>Her confeſſion to Mr <hi>Fowler</hi> who penned it from her own mouth before witneſſe.</p>
               <p>She was taken ill upon Wedneſday in the afternoon in <hi>July</hi> 1653. about nine a clock the ſame night, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared

                  <hi>lifted up with a great deal of joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About four a clock the ſame Fryday. the dark Angel came and ſtood by the other viſion, with a knife in his hand, and ſaid thou haſt had a great deal of joy, and offering her the <hi>knife,</hi> bid her <hi>diſpatch</hi> her ſelf, <hi>and ſhe ſhould enter into that eternall reſt her ſoul ſo much thirſted after,</hi> upon this ſhe trembled, the bed ſhook, and her Mrs held her.</p>
               <p>The ſame Fryday, ſhe had viſions preſented upon the wall, ſhe ſaw the world, and the reſurrection of the dead, <hi>and the ſon of man appearing in the cloudes of heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She ſaw clearly the viſion of a friend of hers, of <hi>London,</hi> in her chamber at <hi>Southcott,</hi> her friend was much inclined to this way, ſhe much wondred at it, and told Mrs <hi>Pordage</hi> of it, who anſwered her, alas ſo do we, <hi>we ſee abundance of thoſe we never knew before, when once they come into our way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On Saturday Dr <hi>Pordage</hi> came to her being ſent for, and prayed in a very ſtrange language, ſhe did not very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what he ſaid, ſhe heard him ſay, Lord, but <hi>nothing</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, but the <hi>abyſſe.</hi> and the <hi>bottomleſſe</hi> eternity.</p>
               <p>She heard a great <hi>noiſe of drums and trumpets,</hi> ſhe ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Dr what the ratling of the drums and trumpets meant, he anſwered her, it was an <hi>alarme to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall warr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One of the nights ſhe ſaw a viſion of young Mr <hi>Daniel Blagrave,</hi> which came to her beds ſide, ſhe took him by

               </p>
               <p>She asked Dr <hi>Pordage</hi> what the viſions meant ſhe ſaw upon the wall, he anſwered <hi>that they durst not reveal one anothers viſions,</hi> he did not queſtion, but God would diſcover himſelf, and reveal wonderfull things to her.</p>
               <p>She was from Wedneſday noon till Munday noon, and did not eat one peice of bread, but ſome times drank a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle water and ſugar, and ſhe ſaith ſhe was not ſick at all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt two houres, and when ſhe was about to eat, ſhe had a voice came to her viz,<note n="3" place="margin">The Divell will do more then ſome Quakers, for he will quote the Scripture, but it is as ſome of them do, o deceive.</note>

               <p>She ſaith that ſhe hath oftentimes ſeen at <hi>London</hi> flaſhes of light in her chamber, and at laſt heard a voice which put her into a very great fear and ſweat, ſaying to her, <hi>thou haſt married a lump of clay, but thou must return to thy firſt husband, which is thy Saviour, thou muſt go to</hi> Joppa: And upon this ſhe was convinced that theſe viſions were of the Divell, becauſe the voice was clean contrary to the Scriptures. ſhe ſaith that ſhe hath heard it reported at<note n="*" place="margin">At Mr <hi>D.

               </p>
               <p>That about <hi>Michaelmas</hi> in the year 1653 he was commanded by his Angel or from Heaven, to give off prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and take no tithes, but ſince he conceives he hath had a diſpenſation.</p>

               <p>I came into <hi>Bradfield</hi> Parſonage in the evening, and there I heard a very mournfull cry, as if it had been one in extreme paines, but who it was I knew not, but it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the time that I was at the door, which was well near a quarter of an hour, and ſo it continued when I went away, and then the tenth day in the morning I came unto Mr <hi>Francis Pordage</hi> at the parſonage of <hi>Stanford Dingley,</hi> and he enquired of me what I did think of the noiſe that I heard, I told him I could not tell, then he related to me, the Lord was about a great work in this kingdom, and to this nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the cauſe of this cry was one in travell, and the pains were ſo extreme, that if I had ſtayed there but a little longer, I might have heard it as far as the town, but now <hi>ſhe was delivered of a man-child, and the travell was at an end, and that he and others were eye witneſſes of it.</hi>

I beſeech you conſider whether this earth be not the place where the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell walks up and down, ſeeking whom he may devour: how then can <hi>Bradfield</hi> or any other place, he exempted from his appearing when God permits, and may not all this be for the manifeſting of his glory, goodneſſe, and power? and who can tell whoſe family may be next ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, by Gods permiſſion to be tryed and proved by the repreſentations of Satan, and I deſire you ſeriouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:118791:50"/> how any ſuch apparitions raiſed by the Divell, and permitted by God, for his own glory, argue me either ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, ſcandalous, or inſufficient, ſurely it rather argues, that he hath bleſt me with a ſtrong faith in that he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch great tryalls, and made me inſtrumentall to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, by prayer and faſting: if it can be proved that I ever ſo much as looked toward the unlawfull art of black magick, or that any evill ſpirits were raiſed up, by any compact of mine, explicite or implicite, or that theſe evill apparitions, were ſubdued and overcome by any other means, then by Gods bleſſing upon our faſting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I ſhall judge my ſelf worthy of puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>But otherwiſe it is hard meaſure to be proſecuted, for the malice of the devil towards me, inflicting what I was paſſive in, and could not help, eſpecially by thoſe who profeſſe the Chriſtian religion, and know that the God of heaven ruler over all, permitting and diſpoſing of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes to paſſe.</p>

                  <p>He further ſaith, that this travell of a man-child was not any naturall birth of a child out of the womb, But the cry that was then made was nothing elſe but the groaning and interceſſion of the ſpirit in her prayer.</p>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as wiſe providences for the tryall of others, of the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian magiſtrate for the probation of his courage, zeal, and love to truth, and of the private chriſtian for the tryall of his faith, that thoſe that are approved may be made manifeſt. Thirdly, As a call from heaven to every one of us to keep <hi>cloſe to Scriptures</hi> to labour for a ſound ſcripturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord Jeſus, to love the truth for the truths ſake, and to practiſe it for Chriſts ſake, from his <hi>love,</hi> and for his <hi>glory.</hi>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of Angelicall Apparitions.</head>
                  <p>We deſire to bring them to the ſcriptures the only ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and <hi>lapis lydius,</hi> that ſo we may try them by the weights and touch of the word: let no man ſay this is a low diſpenſation, if they do, yet their hard words are occaſional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our advantage; the more theſe times vilifie, the more we deſire to magnifie the ſcripture; the wickedneſſe of theſe dayes, by a kind of <hi>antiperiſtaſis,</hi> intending the ſmall heat
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118791:57"/> of our affections toward them; the hiſtory of the word is a ground for a <hi>divine faith,</hi> becauſe the authority is divine; humane authours we do, we can believe, but <hi>humanely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, They were very <hi>rare,</hi> to a very few men, and thoſe eminent, and <hi>extraordinary ones,</hi> as to <hi>Abraham, Jacob, Daniel,</hi> &amp;c. we believe from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and from him to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and from Chriſt to this <hi>day,</hi> we cannot find thirty perſons upon authentick records that have had appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions of Angels, not one Saint amongſt many thouſands.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To thoſe they did appear, they appeared <hi>ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> moſt of theſe few, had they had apparitions of Angels but once leſſe, they had had none at all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They made no tarriance with them, to whom they did appear: we believe, take all the appearances from the creation to this day, and compute the time, it will not in all make up one <hi>naturall</hi> day, take them all together, not 24 houres.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Very few of them did appear, upon their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances; not above two or three at moſt, but moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly but one: and when the ſcripture ſpeaks of Angels plurally, it names their number, as two to <hi>Lot,</hi> three to <hi>Abraham,</hi> two to the ſepulchre of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> unleſſe it be to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.2. and to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. and to the <hi>ſhepheards, Luke</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Their appearance was upon ſome extraordinary buſineſſe, which may be reduced to theſe four heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Either of <hi>tidings</hi> and meſſage, as of a ſon, and ſuch a ſon as <hi>Iſaac</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Sarah,</hi> when the one was an hundred yeares old, and the other ninety: ſo to childleſſe <hi>Manoah,</hi> concerning the birth of <hi>Sampſon:</hi> to <hi>Zachary,</hi> concerning <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt: and to the V. <hi>Mary,</hi> and the <hi>ſhepheards,</hi> to foretell to <hi>Mary,</hi> and declare to the <hi>ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards,</hi> the birth of Jeſus Chriſt, and to declare to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, his reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Angels have appeared for <hi>comfort,</hi> ſo to <hi>Jacob</hi> when he was afraid of <hi>Eſau,</hi> to <hi>Joſhua</hi> at the ſiege of <hi>Jericho,</hi> to <hi>Gideon</hi> againſt the <hi>Midianites,</hi> to <hi>Daniel</hi> in the <hi>captivity,</hi> to the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>agony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:118791:57"/>3. They have appeared for <hi>deliverance,</hi> as to <hi>Lot,</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> when God purpoſed to rain brimſtone, to <hi>Peter</hi> in priſon, when his chains fell off, <hi>Acts.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They have appeared for <hi>direction,</hi> ſo to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> to bid him ſend for a Miniſter, <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some of theſe apparitions were not of created Angels, but of the Angel of the covenant, the Lord Chriſt; as that of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,</hi> and <hi>Gideon,</hi> as appears by the context; beſides theſe the ſcripture records very few. <hi>Austins</hi> rule was, <hi>non credo, quia non lego,</hi> I <hi>believe nothing,</hi> but what I read in the Bible.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Many of theſe few angelicall apparitions were before there was any <hi>ſcripture,</hi> or <hi>written word,</hi> or if after, then, when the prophets were very few, as to <hi>Manoah,</hi> or in the captivity, as to <hi>Daniel,</hi> or before the publication of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Yet behold, here is a man that in the <hi>mid-day</hi> of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, under the compleatneſſe of the word, who tells us of the apparition of bleſſed angels to him and his, more for number, and longer for continuance, then all the ſaints of God from the beginning of the world to this day ever had; nay longer, by at leaſt 20 times, for he enjoyed theſe appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions for 21 dayes together, and is in the way of viſions ſtill, he hath had viſions for theſe five years: and yet the man no way (as we underſtand) extraordinary. We profeſſe we know him not otherwiſe then very mean; if he be in any way more then ordinary, it is in his <hi>magicall,</hi> groſſe <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> his doctrines of <hi>filthineſſe</hi> and <hi>blaſphemy,</hi> his fooliſh pretence of holineſſe, his faculty of ſaying, and unſaying. Let no man ſay we rail, we hope we know, that what we ſpeak is upon record in heaven, both <hi>what</hi> and <hi>how,</hi> and likewiſe to <hi>what end</hi> we ſpeak; we think it is enough to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looſe the tongue of the dumb, <hi>(as it was ſaid of him in the Hiſtorian)</hi> to ſee ſuch ſwords) even bitter words) to be drawn, and their point to be ſet to the very <hi>heart</hi> of religion, and all <hi>Godlineſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſee the Jewels of glory taken out of the crow of Jeſus Chriſt, by wicked hands, and now the Angels muſt be
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118791:58"/> pretended by their <hi>apparitions,</hi> to become vouchers. Oh dreadfull!</p>
                  <p>Then ſecondly, what extraordinary ſervice did God ſend them about? When we conſider the man what he is, for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, very <hi>ſlender,</hi> for <hi>parts, very mean,</hi> as poor as a beggars patcht coat, for religion, <hi>rottenneſſe,</hi> for his doctrine, a <hi>bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemer</hi> of the Lord Chriſt, and a high <hi>reproacher</hi> of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud, for his way, tending to <hi>filthineſſe,</hi> for his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>fallacy</hi> and couſenage: we cannot imagine what buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the glorified Angels ſhould have in his chamber for three weeks together.</p>
                  <p>Give us leave to debate the buſineſſe a little with this Dr, tis poſſible that by that means truth may appear, and give ſome light to the reader.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of what world are thoſe angels that come frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to one of your proſelites, and ſtand at her beds ſide? they neither do any thing, nor ſpeak any thing, do the Angels come from Heaven on ſuch <hi>ſleeveleſſe errands?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of what world was that angel that appeared to her in D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. Tell us of what world, (for you have the key to open miſteries, to uſe ſome of his own words) was that apparition that came to your aforeſaid poor, ſeduced, be-pitied proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, that came to her upon a <hi>white horſe,</hi> and told her that

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Of what order was <hi>that apparition of a ſtarre, or ſomewhat like it, in your chamber</hi> at <hi>Bradfield,</hi> that your maid ſaw, and depoſed it? was it from heaven, or not? you do not ſo much as offer a word of anſwer in your book.</p>
                  <p n="6">6.

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to his Revelations.</head>
                  <p>Revelations properly are either <hi>propheticall,</hi> of things future, <hi>eorum quae Deus vult de nobis,</hi> as the revelation of <hi>John,</hi> or elſe <hi>doctrinall, eorum quae vult à nobis,</hi> as the revelation of <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">He received the goſpel by revelation.</note> and what God would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and practiſe.</p>
                  <p>Now D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>, for your doctrines, we can find nothing in your raptures, but <hi>the doctrine of virginity, which you offer</hi> to prove, but come off moſt ignorantly, which doctrine tends to deſtroy the bond of marriage, and ſo to introduce a more then heatheniſh community.</p>
                  <p>As for your propheſies, we confeſſe there is a great report now among your defiled ones, of great propheſies, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; it hath been ſaid by one of your choiſe ones lately, that <hi>whoſoever comes to be Parſon of</hi> Bradfield, <hi>will find that Miracles are not ceaſed yet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are only two that we have heard of, that look that way.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That in <hi>July</hi> laſt 1654 you even you Dr ſhould be taken up into heaven with a <hi>white ſtaffe</hi> in your hand, and ſhould <hi>come</hi> down again, and <hi>become a great man,</hi> this was related from your mouth by one of your beſt friends, and therefore unlike to bely you, to two perſons that deſire to fear God, who alſo will, if called, atteſt it, what evidence would ſome men have? would they have his <hi>Arthingtons</hi> and <hi>Coppingers</hi> proclaim it in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> why, the times yet will not bear it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That you ſaid confidently (like a prophet) that within two years from the time of your ſpeech, <hi>there ſhould be no government</hi> in <hi>England, neither Parliament,</hi> nor <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> nor any ſuch.</p>
                  <p>This will be depoſed from your own mouth, the laſt of theſe we ſee is falſe, there hath been a <hi>Parliament</hi> ſince that time, and there are Magiſtrates at this day.</p>
                  <p>This did <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> with his viſions and revelations, he prophecyed the deliverance of the town of <hi>Munſter,</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:118791:59"/> which was delivered up, and the prophet was tortured and hanged upon the higheſt ſteeple in an <hi>iron cage,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to this day (ſaith <hi>Spanhemius</hi>) as a monument of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> juſtice, and to learn men to take heed how they <hi>deſpiſe the Deity.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>David George</hi> propheſied of his riſing from the dead too, indeed he was raiſed, but not to life, but to execution, the Senate of <hi>Bazill</hi> being deceived by his ſeeming <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> and <hi>hypocriſie</hi> while he was alive, and being informed of his wicked doctrines againſt the Lord Chriſt, when he was dead, the Magiſtrate <hi>(ſaith Spanhemius)</hi> by a <hi>ſolemn ordinance</hi> commanded his wretched corps in his coffin to the place of <hi>execution,</hi> and there <hi>burnt</hi> it to aſhes.</p>
                  <p>Thus did <hi>Hoſman,</hi> whom his diſciples called <hi>Eliah</hi> (as our Dr is called Father <hi>Abraham</hi>) who ſaid that <hi>Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> was the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> this fellow was clapt up in priſon by the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> propheſied that he <hi>ſhould come</hi> out with an hundred and fourty four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſealed ones, and <hi>ſmite the earth,</hi> but he never came out, but died in priſon, many more might be recited for theſe quaking <hi>familiſticall</hi> times, but we will name but one more, and that is out of <hi>New England.</hi>

                  <p>Dear Sir, I have one thing to tell you, which is a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſage of divine providence amongſt us, here is one <hi>Nicholas Earle</hi> a <hi>Shoemaker,</hi> ſometimes living at <hi>Totnes,</hi> now a ſouldier in the fort of <hi>Plymmouth,</hi> within this moneth he did eſtrange himſelf from God, conceiving there was <hi>no need</hi> of the <hi>miniſtery,</hi> that it muſt down, and that the <hi>Sacraments</hi> were but ceremonies, and the <hi>Sabbath</hi> not to be obſerved, to that purpoſe he argued with ſome about it on the Saturday, my man was preſent, and ſaw him in his hot conteſtation falling to the ground; he deteſted thoſe that bear the image of God, conceiving himſelf the <hi>only Saint,</hi> he was againſt <hi>ſinging of Pſalms,</hi> inſomuch that when others did ſing, he would ſay they did <hi>lie</hi> like Divells; he reſolved to <hi>open</hi> his <hi>Shop windowes</hi> the next Lords day, but on the Saturday night he was under ſtrong temptations, the Divell ſeemed to appear to him with terrible, ſtrange <hi>roarings,</hi> on the Sabbath day he ſent for me, and when I came, at the firſt I was welcome to him, but ſuddenly he <hi>ſpit</hi> in defiance at me, ſeeing him in that temper I left him. The Munday about twelve a clock he came to himſelf, and hath a ſtrong conviction of his errours, whereas he <hi>had left</hi> praying for a bleſſing, and returning thanks for the creatures received, he is now much troubled at the thoughts of it; I have had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with him, he cannot be thankfull enough to God for his mercy in returning him ſo ſoon, he deſires the <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> to <hi>bleſſe God</hi> for his return, and prayes that he may be <hi>ſtedfaſt</hi> in the truth, this that I have written to you is certain truth, you may do well to <hi>acquaint</hi> others to take heed how
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:118791:61"/> they <hi>profeſſedly</hi> ſtep out of Gods wayes, he <hi>wiſheth</hi> that all his friends may take warning by him.</p>
                  <p>Here are ſymptomes of converſion, but the iſſue we know not, reall grace is glorious and rare, upon the one hand of it a man may live <hi>blameleſſe,</hi> and die <hi>Chriſtleſſe,</hi> and upon the other hand, a profane perſon may come to be chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and <hi>terrified</hi> while he lives, and yet to be <hi>tormented</hi> in chains when he dies. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>Either your viſions are contrary to or beſide the written word, or elſe according to it: if the firſt, we demand, how are they from God? if they be revelations of things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſcripture, we demand, why from God? the ground of our demand is from that text, (though we might quote 20 more) <hi>Luke</hi> 16.29. <hi>They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the prophets. Dives anſwered,</hi> nay <hi>Father Abraham, but if one come from the dead, then they will believe,</hi> as if <hi>Dives</hi> had ſaid, tis true, they have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the prophets, <hi>but</hi> non ſatis eſt, <hi>that is not enough;</hi> Abraham <hi>anſwered, if they will not believe</hi> Moſes <hi>and the prophets, neither would they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve though one came from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do we not more certainly ſee and believe the devil to be prince of the air? and do we not more clearly diſcern ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all wickedneſſes in high places? upon the account of the moſt infallible word, then <hi>by ſeeing the devil in a poſtillian</hi> at <hi>Bradfield?</hi> do we not know that he is a lion, and dragon, and old ſerpent, more clearly a thouſand times in the word of God, <hi>then in Dr</hi> Pordages <hi>glaſſe windows and ſieling?</hi> is not the diſcovery of their number, power, malice, fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe more durably laid down in the bleſſed Bible, <hi>then in your brick chimney?</hi> doth not the experience of the ſaints <hi>ſecond</hi> the word, and they <hi>feel</hi> it true, and <hi>ſee</hi> it in others, better then in your <hi>ſulphur, ſoot</hi> and <hi>ſalt?</hi>

                  <p>And becauſe this argument from the fulneſſe of the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is profitable in it ſelf, and ſeaſonable, and direct to our preſent purpoſe, we had thoughts to ſhew the judgements and experience of the ſaints in it, but for fear of tiring our

                  <p>The firſt is <hi>Auſtin,</hi> how doth he raiſe and intend all his faculties to diſcover the glory of the word, it is (ſaith he,<note place="margin">Auſtin. ſer. 38. ad Fratres in eremo.</note>) more <hi>ſweet</hi> then hony, more <hi>pleaſant</hi> then bread, more <hi>ſoft</hi> then oyl, more <hi>pure</hi> then ſilver, more <hi>precious</hi> then gold, the <hi>meat</hi> of angels, the <hi>dainties</hi> of Archangels, the <hi>glory</hi> of the Apoſtles, the <hi>confidence</hi> of the Patriarchs, the <hi>hope</hi> of the Prophets, the <hi>crown</hi> of Martyres, the <hi>doctrine</hi> above all to be beloved, the <hi>breaſts</hi> for the faithfull, the <hi>wiſdome</hi> out of the mouth of the moſt High, the <hi>queen</hi> of all ſapiences, the <hi>ſcience</hi> of ſciences, therefore <hi>legite, attendite:</hi> there we find that God is <hi>length</hi> for eternity, <hi>breadth</hi> for love, <hi>height</hi> for Majeſty, <hi>depth</hi> for wiſdome, it <hi>enlightens</hi> the mind, <hi>purifies</hi> the heart, <hi>ſtrengthens</hi> faith, <hi>conquers</hi> the devil, <hi>contemns</hi> the world, with much more.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond particular is this, That theſe viſions and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations have been an old ſhift of Sathan, and a cheat former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo down to this day.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> of them the <hi>Valentinians</hi> and <hi>Cerinthians</hi> with others, theſe were horrid <hi>railers</hi> againſt Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ſcoffers</hi> of the Apoſtles, kennels of all <hi>noiſomneſſe</hi> and filth, not to be named, non-ſenſicall wreſters of that which they pleaſed to allow for ſcripture, yet they gave out they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ther <hi>doctrine by revelation from heaven;</hi> and it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that when <hi>Cerinthus</hi> was driven to a <hi>non plus,</hi> he ſaid, it <hi>was revealed to him by Chriſt;</hi> and ſo downwards

                  <p>Thirdly, Obſerve, this D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> in all his viſions ſees nothing at all, there is a deep ſilence as to the everlaſting Godhead, and moſt precious bloud of our Lord Jeſus: his viſions teach the way to the <hi>virgin eſſence,</hi> and the <hi>life of perferction,</hi> by way of conformity, which way he ſaw fore-right, and wiſdome that eternall virgin invited <hi>him to follow her in the the way of circumciſion, reſignation, and the croſſe, and ſo on to the reſurrection, aſcenſion, glorification, and fixation,</hi> pag. 77.

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Obſerve, that he aſcribes his height and abſtractedneſſe, and his pretended mortification, and living with God unto his viſions, for ſo he tells you the <hi>good effect of this upon my ſelf and family,</hi>

               <p>But now this Doctor doth not tell us in the leaſt what his temptations were, of what kinde they were, nay in his book he ſaith nothing (where he had a fit opportunity to declare himſelfe) of temptations, but of a conflict between him and a great Dragon, and that he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the Angels, and <hi>pag.</hi> 76. he ſaith, <hi>the great conflict was between the dark world, and the Devils thereof, afflicting them with dreadfull ſhapes, poyſonfull ſmells, and the light world, and the Angels thereof, relieving them with odoriferous perfumes, Angelical harmony,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We deny not but God may ſuffer the Devill to appear to a Saint, but firſt it is very rare; ſecondly, ſuch Saints have been Gods <hi>reall</hi> ones; thirdly, if ſo, yet not to fight and contend with Satan mouth to mouth; fourthly, for a ſhort time, not twenty dayes together; fifthly, they have not an Angel ſtanding by them in their own ſhape to ſupport them: the battell of Saints is within, which through grace they fight with ſpirituall weapons under their Captain the Lord Chriſt, through whom they are more than conquerors: as he <hi>hath</hi> conquered <hi>for them</hi> by his <hi>death,</hi> ſo he <hi>doth</hi> conquer <hi>in</hi> them by his ſpirit.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It is evident, the Civill Sword was appointed as a remedy againſt <hi>Blasphemy:</hi> And</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it was the appointment of Jeſus Chriſt, the Angel of Gods preſence, whom the Jews tempted in the Wilderneſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.9. and therefore it is not true that the Lord Chriſt never appointed the Civill Sword as a remedy in the caſe of Blaſphemy, for he did expreſly appoint it <hi>in the Old Teſtament,</hi> and he never did abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate it <hi>in the New.</hi> The reaſon of the Law (which is the life of Law) is of eternall equity, <hi>viz. Becauſe he hath ſought to thruſt thee away from the Lord thy God, ver.</hi> 9, 10. If Magiſtrates be the Miniſters of God in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, (as they are called <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4.) and Miniſters to puniſh evill doers, then ſurely either this is no evill, <hi>viz. to ſeek to thruſt away Gods people from him,</hi> or elſe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is to execute vengeance <hi>on ſuch, as evill doers, non datur tertium.</hi> Godly Magiſtrates of old did take care for the ſoules of the people, and they did it, not as <hi>types</hi> of Chriſt, but as <hi>ſervants</hi> of Chriſt; for if they did it as types of Chriſt, then that care is utterly aboliſhed, and this very Ordinance by which the Dr is ejected, would be as unlawfull as to offer Sacrifice, &amp;c. which how irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly abſurd is it?</p>
               <p>That ſaying of the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> may deſerve the thoughts of Chriſtian Magiſtrates, <hi>Whatſoever is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the God of heaven for the houſe of God, let it be done diligently, for why ſhould there be wrath againſt the King and his ſons?</hi> Ezra 7.13.</p>
               <p>We deſire the Reader to obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God from Heaven, and Magiſtrates of all forms, as <hi>Emperors, Kings, Queens, free States, Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments,</hi> have looked upon Blaſphemers, Seducers, as bad,

               <p>Object. <hi>Then was then, and now is now.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We doe foreſee this objection, becauſe we doe converſe with it, are well acquainted with it, the cryers up of a Toleration, <hi>The whore of Babylons back-doore,</hi> (as Maſter <hi>Cotton</hi> calls it) uſe to ſpeak much to this purpoſe. But we ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the power of the Civill Magiſtrate in the things of God and Jeſus Chriſt were a truth <hi>then,</hi> it is a truth <hi>now, (the righteouſneſſe of Gods Teſtimonies is everlaſting)</hi> unleſſe they can produce a repeale from God, and they may read till their eyes drop out of their head, before they will find that, <hi>as we beleeve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For our parts</hi> we would not ſtand at the Barre of Chriſt with this guilt upon our hearts, <hi>ſc.</hi> of exempting of the Civill Magiſtrate in the caſe aforeſaid, <hi>That Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may look to it ſelfe if it will,</hi> if ſhe will have a <hi>nurſing Father and Defender,</hi> ſhe may ſeek them: we would not thus be guilty for the gaine of the whole world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our thoughts are, that this objection will not be able to lift up its face, but would think it a friendly office to be buryed under ſome rock or mountaine <hi>at the day of Chriſts appearing with all his Saints.</hi>

               <p>But to proceed.</p>
               <p>The next Commiſsioner taxed by the Doctor is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Trapham,</hi> and that firſt, <hi>for the meanneſſe of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals.</hi> What a bold man is this to cenſure men, and his Superiours, knowing men, and conſcientious?

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For his ſupplanting, the naked truth is, that the buſineſſe concerning a Miniſter for <hi>Wallingford,</hi> was made known to his Highneſſe the <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> who was pleaſed to refer it to Mr. <hi>Caryl,</hi> Mr. <hi>Peters,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lockier,</hi> who according to his Highneſſes order met, and upon hearing on both ſides, after two houres de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate did apprehend, and accordingly did order Maſter <hi>Pickney</hi> to be <hi>the fitter man to be Miniſter of</hi> Walling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Wyer <hi>after ſome convenient time to remove;</hi> A Copy of this Order we have ſeen, and this the Dr calls <hi>ſubtile ſupplanting, and that the Godly party look upon it ſo.</hi>

As for Mr <hi>Wyers</hi> godlineſſe, we wiſh it ſo, we are ſorry that we are forced to write what he hath delivered, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Death of Ieſus Chriſt is not the procuring cauſe of Mans Salvation,</hi> a Doctrine <hi>toto coelo,</hi> inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with reall godlineſſe, or any one duty of it.</p>

               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:118791:85"/>
               <p>The next is, Mr. <hi>Nutkins,</hi> who is reproached by the Doctor <hi>for blinde Zeale and rigidneſſe of Spirit;</hi> A moſt unjuſt and falſe accuſation: the man is a man of eminency for knowledge, piercing into the Scripture, Soundneſſe and Piety; a man <hi>fearing God above many,</hi> a long ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and a great proficient in the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and one of thoſe (happy man he) that loves the truth for the truths ſake, and our Lord Jeſus in ſincerity.</p>
               <p>The laſt that were preſent, but not named, are Maſter <hi>Stroud,</hi> and Major <hi>Fincher,</hi> whom this Doctor calls <hi>more moderate than the reſt, yet their hands were to the Sentence:</hi> we reply yea, and their hearts too, and we believe that they would go from one end of the County to the other upon their bare feet, (rather than it ſhould not be done) to rid the Souls of people from ſuch a Blaſphemer, to whom they give no thanks at all for his <hi>ſeeming commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi>

               <hi>take notice of the rulers of Hell, how much more of the rulers of the world, though made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of the Spirit of this world?</hi> how ugly doth this expreſsion look? yet for a <hi>ſalvo</hi> to ſave his skin, he comes in with an <hi>id eſt,</hi> that is (ſaith he) <hi>according to the wiſe Canons of rationall policy,</hi> what ailes this man? here is not a word of Chriſtian Magiſtrates, are not our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Chriſtians? is not the Goſpell more cleare and pure in <hi>England,</hi> than in moſt, nay any part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world? doe they not take care for the good of precious Soules? the Lord increaſe their care, and pitty to them 1000 fold: 'tis ſadly true we confeſſe, and may it be for a lamentation, that there are many, very many thick fogs of <hi>Familiſme, Socinianiſme, Anti-Scripturiſme</hi> among us, and (were it convenient) we ſhould ſay, that if the Magiſtrates doe not <hi>ſcatter</hi> them, by juſtice, Gods juſtice may ſuffer them to <hi>ſcatter</hi> the Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>He proceeds to diſtinguiſh how men came to power,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:118791:88"/> to this purpoſe ſome, by <hi>immediate Divine deſignation,</hi> ſome by <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> or <hi>Free election,</hi> ſome by <hi>ambition,</hi> but he makes no application of his diſtinction, he doth not tell us, of which of theſe the preſent powers are, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, as we apprehend, not difficult to be rendered, 'tis facile enough, becauſe, if he had applyed his diſtinction, he muſt either have <hi>boldly</hi> affronted the preſent Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, which is not to be endured, or elſe <hi>highly</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſed his owne Sect, which he cannot endure.</p>
            <p>To the laſt member of his diſtinction, ſc. <hi>theſe who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume power</hi> of neceſſity, policy, ambition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he puts a <hi>boundleſſe, &amp; caetera,</hi> leaving himſelfe ſcope enough to ſay what he pleaſes amongſt his owne.</p>
            <p>The Doctor names three wayes of coming to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, indeed this third is no way at all, unleſſe it be of <hi>Boniface, Kniperdoling,</hi> or the Quakers.</p>
            <p>Some wiſe men name a fourth, and that is <hi>Power,</hi> thus, Upon the alteration of Government, either in the <hi>Line,</hi> or in the <hi>Forme,</hi> (and who thinkes that either of theſe ſimply, <hi>in natura rei,</hi> is unalterable, doe we not read the contrary in all Hiſtory? do we not find the contrary in ſome Countries?) in ſuch a caſe, <hi>Power</hi> ſets up <hi>Authority,</hi> which is, as we may ſay, the <hi>materiale,</hi> and this being confirmed by the fundamentall order of the Countrey, where ſuch alteration is made (which is as it were the <hi>formale</hi> of it) becomes fully compleate, and entirely le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall to all the exerciſes of Authority.</p>
            <p>Which in briefe is no more but this, <hi>Power</hi> brings in <hi>Authority,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> is nothing elſe but <hi>eſtabliſhed,</hi> and <hi>regulated Power.</hi> As for mens aſſuming power out of ambition, Pride (which is one of the Doctors brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe heads) we cannot judge of that, For, <hi>Who knowes the minde,</hi> and <hi>ends,</hi> and <hi>deſignes of a Man, but the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man?</hi> Let them look to the ſincerity of their hearts, and againſt the irregularity of theſe baſe ends, for <hi>Every Man ſhall beare his owne burden, whoſoever he be;</hi> but things of this nature are above our <hi>compaſſe,</hi> and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:118791:88"/> without our <hi>buſineſſe,</hi> this being to ſubmit, and not to diſpute, therefore we proceed.</p>
            <p>He tells us, <hi>that he bows to the powers, as</hi> Abraham <hi>did to the Heathen people, and as</hi> Paul <hi>gave the</hi> Ethnick <hi>Princes their titles, appealing for juſtice to</hi> Caeſar, <hi>a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then tyrant, and this may be done by him, (as</hi> Paul <hi>did it) without owning himſelf of, and in union with their corrupt ſocieties.</hi> Further he ſaith, <hi>that as there was no neceſſity for the Jewes who lived in Ethnick Babylon, to partake of their ſins, though they were civill to the power, ſo they that live in Chriſtian Babylon, are not neceſſitated to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of their ſins, though they give them titles, and appeals <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Quakers who would be glad to ſee all the Bibles light and flaming in the fire, doe yet quote them for their owne ends, to deceive; and the people ſay in their <hi>ſimplicity, they quote the Scriptures,</hi> and ſo are <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched</hi> by degrees, when as theſe men hate the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and Blaſpheme them, they meane no ſuch thing; ſo here even in this alſo, this Doctor hath ſaid, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this text now printed by him:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>he cared no more for the higher powers, or any man in England, then he valued the duſt under his feet;</hi> and this in the Pulpit, and as we conceive, nay are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, ſince he hath been in the third Heaven as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He hath ſaid, <hi>that there ſhould be no Parliament, nor Magiſtrate, nor Governor in England ere long,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded how men ſhould or could live without Magiſtrates and Law, he anſwered, the <hi>Saints ſhould
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:118791:89"/> take the Eſtates of the wicked to themſelves, and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhould be their ſlaves, and that there ſhould be a kinde of Majeſty, sparkling out from the Saints that ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-awe the wicked;</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Pordage</hi> ſaid to a profeſſor, <hi>what you have ſhall be ours, and what we have ſhall be yours;</hi> this was ſpoken ſince his inward ſences have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with the Angels, and the eternal world, and it was ſpoken confidently, as if he had been a Prophet, but the time prefixed, which was about two yeares is expired, and he a falſe Prophet.</p>
            <p>Had this Doctor vented this ſtuffe in his Pulpit, or blurted out this riffe raffe before the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or any others elſe, and not publiſhed it in Print to the view of all, we ſhould have buried it in ſilence, and let it have rot, we ſhould have been more reſpectfull to the Government, and the honour of the Nation, then to have publiſhed his <hi>ſaucy</hi> and ſeditious language.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſaith that his Highneſſe, the Councell and the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may thanke the Commiſſioners, for haſtning the poureing the vials of Gods wrath upon the Land for their perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thus the ſhakers pronounce the curſe againſt thoſe that oppoſe them in their deteſtable opinions; what means this man to ſpeak thus? when as the clean contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is true, it is the Magiſtrates doing juſtice upon Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, eſpecially in fundamentals, that is a Scripture way to prevent the powring forth of wrath upon the land, and to preſerve the people from the <hi>Plague, that all Iſrael may hear and feare, and doe no more ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The higher powers have no cauſe to thanke him for his uncivill kindle-cole, appendixe, made meerly to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie ſome, that they may appeale to the Powers, though they and he agree in the maine, <hi>viz. That the Powers not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſuch an appeale are Babiloniſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For our parts we deſire to lead a quiet and peaceable life, where, as here in the land of our Nativity hitherto, we may do ſo in all godlineſſe and honeſty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We bleſſe God, and praiſe him for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:118791:89" rendition="simple:additions"/> of the Goſpel, and we confeſſe we pray againſt a wretched univerſall Toleration.</p>
            <p>A toleration of Idolatry infected the ten Tribes; that Infection proceeded to break forth to a Botch, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Idolaters; that Idolatry was the chief Sinne from whence came their Captivity, which Captivity was into a ſtrange Land, where they continue to this time.</p>
            <p>God did forbid them to ſuffer any ſtrange Gods, nay not to ask after their names, nor to enquire how the Nations did worſhip them: but they hearkned not, <hi>They mingled themſelves with the heathen,</hi> Pſal. 106, 35, 36. And what then? <hi>they learned their works;</hi> What works? <hi>they worſhipped their Idols;</hi> And what followes? <hi>which became alſo their ruine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They had many warnings and Sermons from God by the Prophet; but perhaps they thought they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and wiſe enough, than ever to <hi>ſay to a ſtone, thou art my Father,</hi> or to <hi>worſhip the hoaſt of Heaven</hi> (as many a man in <hi>England</hi> would have even ſpit in a mans face, if he ſhould have been told 12. years ſince, that he would deny Sabbath, nay Scripture, nay Chriſt the Lord, with an <hi>Am I Dog,</hi> which yet is wofully come to paſs) by this meanes they were enſnared, and did as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and were well nigh 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
